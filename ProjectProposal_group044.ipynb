    "The emergence of COVID-19 in March, 2020, has resulted in mandated quarantines, stay at home rules, and smaller social gatherings in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. A systematic review conducted by Loades et al found that such closures have led to social isolation and loneliness across children and adolescents across various countries such as the United States, China, Europe, Australia, India, Malaysia, Korea, Thailand, Israel, Iran, and Russia (Loades). Other global surveys such as the COVIDiSTRESS survey have also found the presence of emotional distress, anxiety-related behaviors, and stress as a result of isolation (Yamada). \n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to lessen the feeling of loneliness is through social media and other platforms that offer social interactions. One of these platforms is multiplayer games with social interactions. Other methods of promoting social connection and social distancing during lockdowns have surfaced such as the World Health Organization’s initiation of a campaign through the hashtag #PlayApartTogether (Todd). During the pandemic, gaming has allowed people to keep in touch with others more than ever before by acting as an alternative to in-person meetings and hangouts. Social interactions by gaming had increased between friends “for the sake of spending time together and hanging out” (Kelly). Online communication applications like Discord, whose user count doubled in size between 2019 and 2021, has facilitated the ability to interact virtually with other people (Curry). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first phase of the pandemic, gamers who usually enjoyed multiplayer games exhibited an increase in playtime. A third of these gamers reported experiencing an increase of importance in having social interaction aspects in video games (Cmentowski). The importance of playing games with friends amongst gamers doubled during the first 3 months of the pandemic compared to the period of time before the pandemic, while the importance of commitment factor decreased dramatically (Cmentowski). \n",

    "We hypothesize that video games with social properties/interactions will gain popularity over the course of the pandemic. We believe that the emergence of the pandemic along with corresponding guidelines such as the stay at home rule has led to an increase in time spent at home. We believe that with this increase in time spent at home during the pandemic and decreased in-person social interactions, people are more likely to play video games with social properties/interactions. There may also be an increase in virtual interactions through social media apps like Discord.\n"

    "Ideal datasets would include the video games with popularity scores before the pandemic began as well as video games with popularity scores during the pandemic. We aim to have several hundreds of observations. We would use video games that appear in both datasets. Each dataset would also include the genre of these games such as the presence or absence of social properties and player counts of each game in monthly intervals. If the data is collected and stored properly, then it should be simple to look at, with each row representing each video game, such that each row contains the video game’s title and the corresponding information such as different years and other useful categorical/numerical data in separate columns. An alternative to the dataset is each row represents a single individual and their collected gaming information before and after the pandemic."

    "The dataset may be collected from people of different ages including minors so it is important to make sure personal identifying information is removed for all users. We can detect this type of information by scanning the rows and columns and removing them using code. We may also see some bias in the dataset depending on which website we get it from because the data may be skewed towards gamers and not the general population or vice versa or focus on a certain age group. We will try to workaround that by searching hard for datasets that will help us directly answer the research questions. We can also detect the biases in the dataset when we analyze the data and plot the data visually, looking for extreme skewness. We also have some concerns about performing the analysis on the dataset. Websites providing the dataset may not provide background information about the data. Therefore, we will collectively decide whether certain datasets will be credible enough through our own research of outsiders' opinions about the source of said dataset."
